In 2019, my coding journey began in earnest as I became enthralled by the opportunities presented by both the internet and database querying. A strange combination I know, but it was the desire to build things for other people and an intellectual fascination with SQL that propelled me into the world of software development. Since then, I have spent time building my own projects, working in the insurtech space and most recently learning about the beauty of TDD, OOP and lots more, at the Makers Academy. I am very excited to join a company where I can add value and learn from a great team.
        
## Relevant Experience

**Makers Academy** (Jun 2021 to Oct 2021)  

- Became proficient in Ruby and Javascript completing a wide range of projects in both languages.
- Followed TDD approach when building applications using RSpec, Jasmine and Cypress for feature testing. Continuously sought feedback on: testing behaviour and not implementation, encapsulation, SRP, dependency injection principle and isolating tests.
- Built Node.js backend from scratch for several projects solidifying my knowledge of MVC architecture. Did self-directed learning on separation of model into database logic and business logic.

**By Bits** (Feb 2021 to Jun 2021)  
_Junior Developer_

- Built tools for pay-per-mile car insurance in a fast-moving start-up environment. Used knowledge of React and HTTP protocol to create user flows and presented this work to the team.
- Used Node.js, Jest and Postman to update and test API endpoints. This improved functionality for the end user and enabled the company to gain further customer traction.
- Used PostgreSQL knowledge to write tests for DB calls ensuring increased robustness of the database logic layer.

**Coding and building projects** (May 2020 to Jan 2021)  

- Spent time learning about coding and lots of other things. Built a full-stack project called [Leyendo](https://cocky-easley-edf596.netlify.app/Sam%20Altman) which enables users to find their favourite essays from across the the internet.

**itsu [grocery]** (Dec 2016 to Apr 2020)  
_Supply Chain Executive & Supply Network Planner_

- Created a suite of SQL-enabled reports including a sales dashboard, a new service level tracker and an invoice tracker. This highlighted my proactivity and ability to see tasks through to completion. The reports resulted in 5+ hours being saved per week across multiple teams.
- Was given responsbility to lead weekly ‘demand and supply review’ as a result of my strong communication skills. Used responsibility to challenge sales team on forecasting and allocated actions. My leading the weekly meeting resulted in a 12% increase in forecast accuracy YoY.

**Buzzhire (on-demand temporary staffing platform)** (Jan 2016 to Oct 2016) 
_Operations Manager_

- Launched a new vertical, growing monthly revenue from zero to £5k per week during the first four months. Then achieved client retention of 70% MoM. This showed my ability to meet challenging targets while working autonomously.
- Led a project to implement geographical restrictions on the app as a result of customer feedback. Utilised collaborations skills and attention to detail to complete the project which resulted in sub 4* reviews decreasing by 11%.

## Projects

|Project        |Description                                           |Technologies              |
|----------|------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
|[chitter-v2](https://github.com/danroche10/chitter-v2)|A CRUD application that enables authenticated users to post, comment and like 'peeps'. Live heroku version [here](https://shrouded-savannah-60836.herokuapp.com/)<br><br> The app was built using TDD with Jasmine spies being used to isolate code. Researched best practice for how to structure model and decided to separate database and business logic. The project helped solidify my knowledge of the HTTP protocol, MVC architecture, Encapsulation, feature testing and deployment. | Built using Javascript, Express, Jasmine, Cypress, ejs and Node.js |
|[bowling-challenge-JS](https://github.com/danroche10/bowling-challenge-JS)|A command-line application that scores a game of bowling including strikes, spares and perfect game.<br><br> Sought feedback multiple times from the Head of Coaching at Makers on this project. As a result I deepened my understanding of Encapsulation, SRP and code quality. In addition, I gained clarity on private implementation methods and why we should test behaviour rather than these methods.|Jasmine, Javascript|
|[bank-tech-test](https://github.com/danroche10/bank-tech-test)|A command-line application that enables users to create an account, deposit/withdraw money and print statements with balance.<br><br> Again sought feedback multiple times from a Makers coach. Deepened understanding of Dependency Injection Principle and learnt best practice for instantiating a class in the method of another class with correct testing.<br><br> Coach feedback included “Overall this is a fantastic solution” and “You’ve shown good understanding of Separation of Concerns, testing Behaviour not State, test Isolation, Encapsulation, SRP and how to write JavaScript”. | Javascript, Jasmine |
