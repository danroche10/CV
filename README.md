In 2019, I became fascinated with the internet and the opportunities that it could present to people across the globe. During this time, I was also teaching myself SQL at work and loved using it to solve complex problems. I decided to marry these two interests and left my job to learn more about coding and build some interesting projects. This fascinating journey led me to work at a insurtech startup for three months and most recently to Makers Academy. At Makers I rigourously learnt the fundamentals of programming and built some exciting projects such as the ones listed below.

## Work Experience

**By Bits** (Feb 2021 to June 2021)  
_Junior Developer_

- Built tools for pay-per-mile car insurance in a fast-moving start-up environment. Updated main Node.js APIs and wrote tests in Jest. Used Postman to test endpoints and visualise JSON responses.
- Worked with React on the front-end, implementing user flows and managing state between each step. Made HTTP requests to the APIs and used JSON responses in user flow.
- Used PostgreSQL to interact with the databases when necessary. Learnt about foreign key constraints, testing databases calls and different environments.
- Other ad-hoc tasks included CSS changes, templating and content changes to company website.
- Used github for version control and became familiar with branching, merging and pull requests.


**itsu [grocery]** (Dec 2016 to Apr 2020)  
_Supply Chain Executive & Supply Network Planner_

- After teaching myself SQL, I introduced it into the business to create a sales dashboard, a new service level tracker and an invoice tracker. Resulted in many hours being saved per week across multiple teams.
- Led weekly ‘demand and supply review’, challenging sales team on forecasting and driving actions. Worked closely with an external programmer to build a new automated production planner.

**Buzzhire** (Jan 2016 to Oct 2016)
_Operations Manager_

- Buzzhire is an on-demand temporary staffing platform. Initially the role focused on client acquisition and building a new vertical, before evolving into client operations. Enhanced my sales skills and my ability to analyse and interpret data. 
- Grew monthly revenue from zero to £5k per week during the first four months. Then achieved client retention of 70% MoM. Worked with CTO to implement new features such as variable pricing and geographical restrictions.

## Education

#### Makers Academy (June 2021 October 2021)
- Became proficient in Ruby and Javascript completing a wide range of projects in both languages (both vanilla and within framworks).
- Learnt about the core principles of OOP and became familiar with the four pillars. Used this knowledge when modelling and then building applications.
- Followed a TDD approach when building applications using RSpec, Jasmine and Cypress for feature testing. Continuously sought feedback on: testing behaviour and not implementation, using private methods for implementation, dependency injection principle and isolating tests using mocks/spies.
- Built Node.js backend from scratch for several projects solidfying my knowledge of MVC architecture. Did self-directed learning on separation of model into database logic and business logic. 
- Spent a lot of time pair programming enabling improvement in communication when explaining code, thought process and bug fixing.

#### University of Bath (2011 to 2015)

- BSc (Hons) Economics – 2:1

## Hobbies

As an avid runner, I have completed a marathon in 3 hours 13 minutes and a half-marathon in 1 hour 25 minutes.
I spend a lot of my free time reading and review each book I read on [goodreads.](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/60295249?shelf=read)
