In 2019, I became fascinated with the internet and the opportunities that it could present to people across the globe. During this time, I was also teaching myself SQL at work and loved using it to solve complex problems. I decided to marry these two interests and left my job to learn more about coding and build some interesting projects. This fascinating journey led me to work at a insurtech startup for three months and most recently to Makers Academy. At Makers I rigorously learnt the fundamentals of programming and built some exciting projects such as the ones listed below.

## Work Experience

**By Bits** (Feb 2021 to June 2021)  
_Junior Developer_

- Built tools for pay-per-mile car insurance in a fast-moving start-up environment. Used knowledge of React and HTTP protocol to create user flows and presented this work to the team.
- Used Node.js, Jest and Postman to update and test API endpoints. This improved functionality for the end user and enabled the company to gain further customer traction.
- Used PostgreSQL knowledge to write tests for DB calls ensuring increased robustness of the database logic layer.

**Coding and building projects** (May 2020 to Jan 2021)  

- Spent time learning about coding and lots of other things. Built a full-stack project called [Leyendo](https://cocky-easley-edf596.netlify.app/Sam%20Altman) which enables users to find their favourite essays from across the the internet.

**itsu [grocery]** (Dec 2016 to Apr 2020)  
_Supply Chain Executive & Supply Network Planner_

- Created a suite of SQL-enabled reports including a sales dashboard, a new service level tracker and an invoice tracker. This highlighted my proactivity and ability to see tasks through to completion. The reports resulted in 5+ hours being saved per week across multiple teams.
- Was given responsbility to lead weekly ‘demand and supply review’ as a result of my strong communication skills. Used responsibility to challenge sales team on forecasting and allocated actions. My leading the weekly meeting resulted in a 12% increase in forecast accuracy YoY.

**Buzzhire (on-demand temporary staffing platform)** (Jan 2016 to Oct 2016) 
_Operations Manager_

- Launched a new vertical, growing monthly revenue from zero to £5k per week during the first four months. Then achieved client retention of 70% MoM. This showed my ability to meet challenging targets while working autonomously.
- Led a project to implement geographical restrictions on the app as a result of customer feedback. Utilised collaborations skills and attention to detail to complete the project which resulted in sub 4* reviews decreasing by 11%.

## Education

#### Makers Academy (June 2021 October 2021)
- Became proficient in Ruby and Javascript completing a wide range of projects in both languages (both vanilla and within frameworks).
- Learnt about the core principles of OOP and became familiar with the four pillars. Used this knowledge when modelling and then building applications.
- Followed a TDD approach when building applications using RSpec, Jasmine and Cypress for feature testing. Continuously sought feedback on: testing behaviour and not implementation, encapsulation, SRP, dependency injection principle and isolating tests using mocks/spies.
- Built Node.js backend from scratch for several projects solidifying my knowledge of MVC architecture. Did self-directed learning on separation of model into database logic and business logic. 
- Spent a lot of time pair programming enabling improvement in communication when explaining code, thought process and bug fixing.

#### University of Bath (2011 to 2015)

- BSc (Hons) Economics – 2:1

#### Dame Alice Owen’s School (2003 - 2010)                                                                                                                                        
- A-Levels: Mathematics (A*), Economics (A), Physics (A); AS levels: Further Mathematics (A), Chemistry (A)
- GCSEs: 4 A*’s, 6 A’s	

## Hobbies

As an avid runner, I have completed a marathon in 3 hours 13 minutes and a half-marathon in 1 hour 25 minutes.
I spend a lot of my free time reading and review each book I read on [goodreads.](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/60295249?shelf=read)
