## Work Experience

**By Bits** (Feb 2021 to June 2021)  
_Junior Developer_

- Worked with React on the front-end, implementing user flows and managing state between each step. Made HTTP requests to the APIs and used JSON responses in user flow.
- Used PostgreSQL to interact with the databases when necessary. Learnt about foreign key constraint, testing databases and different environments.
- Other ad-hoc tasks included CSS changes, templating and content changes to company website.
- Used github for version control and became familiar with branches, merging and pull requests.


**itsu [grocery]** (Dec 2016 to Apr 2020)

- After teaching myself SQL, I introduced it into the business to create a sales dashboard, a new service level tracker and an invoice tracker. Resulted in many hours being saved per week across multiple teams.

**Buzzhire** (Jan 2016 to Oct 2016)

## Education

#### Makers Academy (June 2021 October 2021)

- Built Node.js backend from scratch for several projects solidfying my knowledge of MVC architecture. Did self-directed learning on separation of model into database logic and business logic. 
- Spent a lot of time pair programming enabling improvement in communication when explaining code, thought process and bug fixing.
